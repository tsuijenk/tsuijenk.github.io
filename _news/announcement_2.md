Jenkin presented his latest results on AnglerFISH at BIGX 2022 Conference (held at UBC). AnglerFISH is a deep-learning based method that simultaneously detect, localize and classify emitters to RNA molecules. It has the ability to co-register spots across multiple rounds of smFISH imaging (such process is collectively known as MERFISH).
