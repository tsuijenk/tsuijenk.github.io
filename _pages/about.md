<b>Jenkin Tsui</b> is a PhD Candidate at BC Cancer Research Centre. His doctoral thesis is focusing on the development of machine learning approaches in characterizing the tumour microenvironment (TME), advised by <a href='https://aroth85.github.io/'>Andrew Roth</a>. His advisory committee includes: <a href='https://aparicio.molonc.ca/team/Aparicio-Samuel'>Samuel Aparicio</a>, <a href='https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/'>Alexandre Bouchard-Côté</a>, and <a href='https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/'>Leonid Sigal</a>. Jenkin graduated with a high distinction with a B.S. in <a href='https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/cms/'>Mathematics and Statistics</a> from the University of Toronto, advised by <a href='https://www.utstat.toronto.edu/mikevans/'>Michael Evans</a>, <a href='http://www.math.toronto.edu/tiozzo/'>Giulio Tiozzo</a>, and <a href='https://faculty.tru.ca/jtomal/pages/future-students.html'>Jabed Tomal</a>. Subsequently, Jenkin graduated with a M.A. in <a href='https://statistics.yale.edu/'>Statistics and Data Science</a> from Yale University. 

Jenkin's undergraduate research interest in probing big data earned him an exchange opportunity to study abroad at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor as a <a href='https://www.fulbright.ca/programs/killam-fellowships/canadians'>Fulbright Killam Fellow</a>. Aside from that, Jenkin led a research project at <a href='https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/about/about'>Statistics Canada</a> that focused on record linkage problem, advised by <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abel-Dasylva-2'>Abel Dasylva</a>. He provided a proof by contradiction for a maximum likelihood estimating equation for logistic regression and proposed an optimal likelihood estimation that is based on quasi-likelihood theory. This resulted in a conference publication and contributed paper session at the <a href='https://www.jointmathematicsmeetings.org//meetings/national/jmm2018/2197_amscp.html'>Joint Mathematics Meeting 2018</a>. During his time at Yale University, he completed a statistical case studies course with the grade of Honors that prepared him for a career in statistical consultancy, while simultaneously directed his research studies in hierarchical Bayesian models with applications to fMRI data, advised by <a href='https://statistics.yale.edu/people/joseph-chang'>Joseph Chang</a>. This led him pursuing bioinformatics research at the <a href='https://www.ims.riken.jp/english/'>RIKEN Institute, Center for Integrative Medical Science</a>. During his time as a RIKEN fellow, he took part in the <a href='https://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/6/'>FANTOM6</a> project and investigated the secondary structures of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), advised by <a href='https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/ims/genom_algo/index.html'>Michiel de Hoon</a>. Jenkin also had industry experience working as a Fraud Investigator and an Accounting Analyst at Scotiabank.

Aside from his academic interests, Jenkin had been an active member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets Program. Since completing the program at the rank of Flight Sergeant, he continued serving as a Civilian Instructor and contributed to 5 years of youth training and mentorship with <a href='http://180mosquito.ca/'>180 Mosquito Squadron</a>. Throughout his career, he had developed extensive experience in counselling, instructions, team leadership, administration, and logistics management. He also led the production and filming of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLbJG0_0tJmuVQKY_Ji9NmO3-P1H48ZlDU'>multiple promotional videos</a> at Region Gliding School (Northwest) that resulted with public popularity and the School Commanding Officer's commendation. Jenkin also regularly practices Wing Chun Martial Arts and studies Japandi design and Japanese tea. Jenkin speaks native Cantonese and English, professional Mandarin, and is currently learning Japanese.
